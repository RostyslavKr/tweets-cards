# Tweet Cards

This is an application for displaying cards of Twitter users with the ability to
connect between Follow and Following states. The cards contain the user's photo,
name and number of followers. The Follow / Following button changes text and
color when clicked.

### Completing the task

The application was implemented on React using the Axios library to retrieve
data via the Mockapi.io API. When starting the program, the first user page with
pagination appears on the screen. Clicking on a user's web page will take you to
the user's details page, where you can click the Subscribe / Subscribe buttons.
